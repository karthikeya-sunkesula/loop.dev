A systems engineering blog built around a continuous learning loop:
**computer architecture → C programming → kernel & OS concepts → embedded systems essentials → power and performance engineering**

This site connects fundamentals with real-world systems like **Linux**, **Android**, and **ARM-based SoCs**.
