A systems engineering blog following a continuous learning loop:

**computer architecture → C programming → kernel & OS concepts → embedded systems essentials → power and performance engineering**

This site connects fundamentals with real-world systems like **Linux**, **Android**, and **ARM-based SoCs**.

## 🔁 The Learning Loop

The topics here are not meant to be learned linearly.  
Each layer reinforces the others — forming a continuous loop of understanding.
