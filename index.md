title: The Loop
---

A systems engineering blog following a continuous learning loop:

**computer architecture → C programming → kernel & OS concepts → embedded systems essentials → power and performance engineering**

This site connects fundamentals with real-world systems like **Linux**, **Android**, and **ARM-based SoCs**.

## 📌 About This Site

The Loop is designed for engineers who want **deep system-level understanding**, not surface-level tutorials.  
Each topic feeds back into architecture — reinforcing learning through repetition and practice.
